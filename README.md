# AI for City Districts: Measuring City Districtsâ€™ Sustainability using Satellite Data

This repository contains codes and data for performing city classification prediction tasks.

Original dataset contains raw 1585 images of 4800 x 4800 resolution (16 GB). Raw data, processed dataset, and models altogether can be downloaded by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/vsg8SqTB1V6iqXx3A).
Alternatively, models only can be accessed at [this google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-7C7YY3ejCsLZlXKM5o0E8kT5IY2ROyK?usp=sharing).

Dataset consists of 45 cities from various locations, and mostly chosen from [Arcadis Index 2022](https://www.arcadis.com/en/knowledge-hub/perspectives/global/sustainable-cities-index). Additional 8 cities (Almaty, Ankara, Ashgabat, Astana, Baku, Bishkek, Shymkent, and Tashkent) underrepresented in Arcadis Index is also part of the dataset.

Cities and their corrresponding index values from 9 different sustainability ranking systems which were used for model training:

# Downloading the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IS2AI/city-classification-and-index-prediction
```

# Pre-processing 

Prior to training it is necessary to perform pre-processing on raw images. To generate patches out of raw images needed for training, and to perform train-val-test split launch the following script:

```
python3 preprocessing.py
```

# Training

To launch training for city index predition use:
```
python3 train_regression.py
```

# Inference

To test city index prediciton on unseen patches run:
```
python3 test_regression.py
```

# Sustainability map creation

To create sustainability color map, there is available another script:

```
python3 make_sustainability_map.py
```
